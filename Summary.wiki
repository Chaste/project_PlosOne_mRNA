Welcome to the Chaste wiki.
	
This section contains pages generated automatically from the source code accompanying "mRNA Expression Levels Predict Cellular Electrophysiological Remodeling in Failing Human Hearts: A Population-Based Simulation Study", our paper soon to be published in PLoS ONE.
	
Before running the example you will need to [wiki:InstallGuides/InstallGuide install Chaste's dependencies] and the [http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/download.html source code for version 3.1].
The easiest way to do this is using an Ubuntu machine (or an Ubuntu virtual machine) as discussed on InstallGuides/UbuntuPackage.
Note that Chaste is only supported on Linux/Unix systems, so users of Windows or Mac OS X will need to follow the virtual machine route.
For manual installation of each dependency, on any version of Linux, see DeveloperInstallGuide.

Results used in the paper are generated using the Chaste code contained within this example. Some post-processing and the graph plotting is then performed by the Matlab code in the matlab folder of the !PlosOne_mRNA user project, available from [http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/download the main download site]. 
Before looking at the source code, you may wish to look at some of the [UserTutorials basic user tutorials].

For further information on using Chaste, see our [wiki:ChasteGuides extensive guide material].
